# ULPGC-EDUROAM-FIX-For-Linux-
Since the staff at ULPGC refuse to help linux users i fexed ts

Context:
    I have used the official eduroam installer for Linux (eduroam CAT) corresponding to ULPGC, which configures:
    EAP‑TTLS.
    Inner authentication (phase2) PAP.
    ULPGC CA certificate.
    Server verification parameter: altsubject-matches=DNS:radius.ulpgc.es.
    When attempting to connect, the client (wpa_supplicant via NetworkManager) establishes association with the access point, but during the TLS phase of EAP authentication a systematic failure occurs. In the logs (journalctl) messages appear such as:
    TLS: altSubjectName match 'DNS:radius.ulpgc.es' not found
    CTRL-EVENT-EAP-TLS-CERT-ERROR ... err='AltSubject mismatch'
    SSL_connect error: ... certificate verify failed
    That is, the client correctly receives the RADIUS server certificate (CN=radius.ulpgc.es and ULPGC CA), but the altsubject-matches check fails because the server certificate does not include DNS:radius.ulpgc.es in the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field.
    The certificate is issued by ULPGC itself and is temporally valid, but it follows the “classic” scheme (CN), whereas the CAT profile assumes a “modern” use based on SAN.
    The consequence is that any Linux user who:
    Uses the official ULPGC eduroam installer, and
    Has server verification with altsubject-matches enabled,
will encounter an authentication loop: the system rejects the certificate of ULPGC’s own server because of this discrepancy between the certificate and the configuration generated by the institution itself.
    As a temporary diagnostic measure, the connection works immediately if certificate verification is disabled (removing the CA or altsubject-matches), which confirms that the problem is not the credentials or the operating system, but the certificate validation policy. Obviously this “solution” is insecure and should not be recommended to users.
Temporary solution applied:
sudo nmcli connection modify eduroam 802-1x.ca-cert "" 802-1x.altsubject-matches ""
nmcli --ask connection up eduroam
    The correct and secure solution that I am currently applying (and which could be recommended to other advanced Linux users) is:
    Keep the ULPGC CA certificate in order to validate the trust chain.
    Remove the altsubject-matches parameter.
    Replace it with domain-suffix-match=ulpgc.es (or another value you consider appropriate that is consistent with the current server certificate).
In this way:
    It is still verified that the certificate is issued by the ULPGC CA.
    It is verified that the server name ends in ulpgc.es.
    It is not required that the SAN contain exactly DNS:radius.ulpgc.es, avoiding the current conflict.
